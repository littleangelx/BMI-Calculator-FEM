## Overview

A BMI calculator webpage plus information about the usage and limitations of BMI as a reliable measure of health.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select whether they want to use metric or imperial units
- Enter their height and weight

- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

I learnt how to use Flexbox which was very exciting as previously I had just been using absolute positioning and putting in (for example) values for the left and the top. 

I practised Javascript which I have not used that much before. I used query selectors, event listeners, if statements and for loops. I also wrote a calculateBMI function which can also convert from imperial units to metric in order to allow the calculation of BMI.


### Continued development

I want to practise more with Flexbox. I also want to try mobile-first development rather than desktop-first which is what I am used to. I would also like to refactor my Javascript.
